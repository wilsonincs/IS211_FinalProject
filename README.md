# IS211_FinalProject
This is a library management system The app has a basic login, you can see the book collection, see if a book is available or not (if not, you can see who has it), borrow &amp; return a book, add a book &amp; change its details, add a book using the Google Books API. The app contains QR Codes + Smartphone solution. There is a page in the app that allows you to generate a PFD with QR Codes for a selected list of books, then you can print that page and paste the Codes on the back of the books. This way, someone that wants to borrow/return a book only needs to scan the QR Code, then a browser window will open asking him to confirm his action, and then he's done! But that part is not done yet, all the other options such as adding books from the google api, manually adding books are available
